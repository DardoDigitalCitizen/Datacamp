# In the video, you learned of another standard Python datatype, strings. Recall that these represent textual data.
# To assign the string 'DataCamp' to a variable company, you execute:
company = 'Datacamp'

#You've also learned to use the operations + and * with strings.
# Unlike with numeric types such as ints and floats, the + operator concatenates strings together,
# while the * concatenates multiple copies of a string together.
# In this exercise, you will use the + and * operations on strings to answer the question below.
# Execute the following code in the shell:
object1 = "data" + "analysis" + "visualization"
object2 = 1 * 3
object3 = "1" * 3

print(object1)
print(object2)
print(object3)
